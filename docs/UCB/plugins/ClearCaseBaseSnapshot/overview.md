the unified change management (UCM) process. If using UCM, see [ClearCase UCM plug-
in](https://www.urbancode.com/plugin/clearcase-ucm/).


### Compatibility



This plug-in requires IBM UrbanCode Build 
version 6.1 and later.


The plug-in runs on any agents that the IBM UrbanCode Build server supports.

UrbanCode](https://www.urbancode.com/resource/installing-plug-ins-in-urbancode-products/ "Installing plug-ins in 
UrbanCode").
